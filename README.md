## Summary
This is one of my big projects that I created using C++ and SFML. Defnight is a combination of multiple games that I have played, with a pixel art style. :)

## How to play
Your objective is to survive for as long as you can. Before the start of the game, you can choose a map, character, and difficulty (more characters coming in the future). The game is split into waves of monsters, with different types of monsters and difficulties. Wave 10 is a boss fight :). To attack, simply hold down the left mouse button and try to get close to the monster you are attacking. Hold down shift to sprint. When you reach a new level, you can choose which attribute to level up. At levels 5 and 10, you can upgrade to a new class with abilities (activated with the right mouse button). Press "E" to enter the shop to buy some boosts :D

## Keybinds
