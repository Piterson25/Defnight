Defnight is a simple single-player mob arena game, with a pixel art style. Your objective is to survive for as long as you can. Before the start of the game, you can choose a map, character, and difficulty (more characters coming in the future). The game is split into waves of monsters, with different types of monsters and difficulties. Every 10th wave is a boss fight. When you reach a new level, you can choose which attribute to level up. At levels 5 and 10, you can upgrade to a new class with abilities. Gold you've collected can be spent in the shop or upgrading abilities.
